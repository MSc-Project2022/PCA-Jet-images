# PCA-Jet-images
This repository contains an implementation of the Eigenfaces algorithm (from scratch), based on Principal Component Analysis for the classification of images. The algorithm is being used to classify JET images from Large Hadron Collider data, as to whether an image belongs to signal or background collisions. Achieved an accuracy of 98.03%.
